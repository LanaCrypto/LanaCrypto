# Låna Project
Låna is an algorithmic, decentralized peer-2-contract non-custodial protocol for lending and borrowing on Algorand.
Låna allows users to borrow, lend, and earn interest on crypto assets without the need for an intermediary. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrency in the pool's smart contracts. At the same time, funds can be borrowed from the pool by issuing collateral. The borrowing model is fully over-collagenized which means users end up depositing more collateral than they end up with as loans. 
Lending and borrowing are controlled by smart contracts that utilize liquidity pools to remove the need to match the borrower to the lender. This allows for instant lending based on the characteristics of pool status.
